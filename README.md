# KLayout Productivity Suite

The *KLayout Productivity Suite* is a set of plugins to boost your layout productivity developed by the [**Department for Integrated Circuits (ICD), Johannes Kepler University (JKU)**](https://iic.jku.at).

This add-on is a meta-package, that can be installed in KLayout's Package Manager. It will then automatically install all the plugins as `dependencies` in the `grain.xml`.
