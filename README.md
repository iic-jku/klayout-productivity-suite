# KLayout Productivity Suite

The *KLayout Productivity Suite* is a collection of plugins developed by the [**Department for Integrated Circuits (ICD), Johannes Kepler University (JKU)**](https://iic.jku.at) to enhance your layout design productivity.

This add-on acts as a meta-package that can be installed in KLayout's Package Manager. Once installed, it automatically pulls in all the plugins as `dependencies` through the `grain.xml`.

Included plugins (alphabetically):

   * https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-align-tool
   * https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-auto-backup
