## Supported PDKs

Currently, we support the following PDKs:

   - `IHP SG13G2`: https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-layer-shortcuts/blob/main/pdks/ihp-sg13g2.json
   - Skywater `sky130`: https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-layer-shortcuts/blob/main/pdks/sky130.json
   - Global Foundries `gf180mcu`: https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-layer-shortcuts/blob/main/pdks/gf180mcu.json

You can add support for additional PDKs by writing a JSON configuration file:

- copy [the existing JSON file](https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-layer-shortcuts/blob/main/pdks/ihp-sg13g2.json) and ensure the PDK name is volare/ceil compatible
- Noters about the JSON file format
   - NOTE: Layer names must be the same as in the KLayout layer properties XML file (e.g. `~/.volare/ihp-sg13g2/libs.tech/klayout/tech/sg13g2.lyp`)
   - NOTE: The technology name must be the same as in the KLayout technology XML file (e.g. `~/.volare/ihp-sg13g2/libs.tech/klayout/tech/sg13g2.lyt`)
   - NOTE: The layer group names must be unique but are completely custom
